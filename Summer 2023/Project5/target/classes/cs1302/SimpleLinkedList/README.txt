This directory contains a partial implementation of the
SimpleLinkedList class.  The files in this directory
include:

SimpleList.java           -- an interface defining all necessary
                             operations of our List ADT

SimpleLinkedList.java     -- a class implementing the SimpleList interface.
                             Many methods and inner classes are fully
                             implemented, but you will need to provide
                             the implemention of the 3 methods listed in
                             the project description.

SimpleLinkedListTest.java -- a simple test class (notJUnit) to check
                             the operation of SimpleLinkedList class
                             methods.

SimpleLinkedListTest.log  -- expected output of the above test class.
                             You may use it to verify your
                             implementation of the 3 required methods.

DemoSimpleLinkedList.java -- another test class illustrating how to
                             use the SimpleLinkedList class.

DemoSimpleLinkedList.log  -- expected output of the above test class.
                             You may use it to verify your
                             implementation of the 3 required methods.

DemoSimpleLinkedList2.java and
DemoSimpleLinkedList2.log -- yet another illustration of using
                             SimpleLinkedList with the associated
			     expected output file.
			     
The classes directory is empty.
