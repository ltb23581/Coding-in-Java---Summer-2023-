This is a simple example illustrating a JavaFX app which opens a new
modal window.  It also illustrates how to implement vertical scrolling
to display a longer text.

This example is a Maven project, which was initialized by mvn, as
described in the Developing JavaFX programs on odin guide.
Consequently, it is very easy to work with this example.

To compile the example, execute:

  mvn compile

To run it, first start your X11 server, if on a Windows computer (on a
Mac, XQuartz should start automatically) and connect to odin with X11
forwarding enabled, as described in the Developing JavaFX programs on
odin guide.

Then, execute:

  mvn javafx:run

You can also clean the project by executing:

  mvn clean
