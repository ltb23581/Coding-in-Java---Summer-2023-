This is a small example illustrating how to read from a CSV file.
It uses an Apache library for reading and writing CSV files.

In order to run this example:

  add commons-csv-1.9.0.jar to your CLASSPATH (the commons-csv-1.9.0.jar
  library is in my classes subdirectory /home/myid/kkochut/classes.
  You may copy this jar file to your own classes directory, if you wish.

To compile the example:

  javac -d classes src/edu/uga/cs1302/csvsample/CSVReader.java

To run the example:

  java edu.uga.cs1302.csvsample.CSVReader
