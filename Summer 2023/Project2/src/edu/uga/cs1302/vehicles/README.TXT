In order to compile the program, the user must be in the "Project2" directory.
From there, the user will input, "javac -d classes/src/edu/uga/cs1302/vehicles/*.java"

To execute the program, the user can be in either the "src" or "classes directory".
To run the program, the user will input "java Main".

Once the program is executed, the user will be prompted with the instructional prompt stating to enter a number between 1~6 or h or q.

Inputting "h" or "help" will prompt the user with a list of what each of the numbers or "h" or "q" outputs.

All numbers have different outputs.

If the user wants to quit the program, they must input "q" or "quit". If the user does not input either of the quit commands, the program will keep looping the initial question.

The user may only input the listed valid inputs. If the user inputs an invalid response, the program will prompt the user with an error message and to try again.
